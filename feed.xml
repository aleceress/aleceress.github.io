She has a knack for encouraging me to push beyond my limits, and that’s one of the things I like most about her.</p> <p>But as soon as I began singing Agnes Obel’s beautiful song <em>Riverside</em>, all of those fears melted away. I was focused solely on my voice and the message I wanted to convey to the audience. It was like experiencing a new form of honest communication, free from the fear of being misunderstood.</p> <h4 id="2021-12-04-the-first-time-i-played-the-piano-in-public"><strong>2021-12-04: The first time I played the piano in public</strong></h4> <p>This rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mGn6Qf5dEM">Paper Forest</a> was intentionally slowed down, as I was still learning to play the piano.</p> <p>Later on I decided to keep it like that, to encourage more attention to the lyrics. I wanted to transmit that as women we often feel the need to navigate between a safe space and another: this often assumes the shape of a man, whose perspective we risk relying on to explain our thruths.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Now you’re blessed amongst all women,</em> <em>now a man who’s very good.</em> <br/> <em>He tells you how you feel until your life is understood.</em> <br/> <em>And he leads you through it arm in arm as though there was a map to guide the way.</em> <em>Now you write because you love him, now you write because he’s kind.</em> <em>You write so much, you look up and you wrote yourself behind.</em></p> </blockquote> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-IrA-EwNZMg" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" style="padding:10px"></iframe> <h4 id="2023-05-21-piano-arranged-bon-ivers-skinny-love"><strong>2023-05-21: Piano-arranged Bon Iver’s Skinny Love</strong></h4> <p>This piano-version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz5s5C6sAt0">Skinny Love by Bon Iver</a> was arranged by my teacher <a href="https://www.instagram.com/giessevocaltraining/?hl=it">Giulia</a> and I loved it at first sound. Performing it on stage was a huge emotion, expecially because the song meaning resonated with some personal experiences of struggling in letting go I needed to give voice to.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>And I told you to be patient,</em><br/> <em>and I told you to be fine.</em><br/> <em>And I told you to be balanced,</em><br/> <em>and I told you to be kind.</em><br/> <em>And now, all your love is wasted,</em><br/> <em>then who the hell was I?</em><br/> <em>‘Cause now I’m breaking at the bridges, and at the end of all your lies.</em></p> </blockquote> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WugNeS8eP4k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <h4 id="2023-05-21-the-funniest-performance-of-my-life-video"><strong>2023-05-21: The funniest performance of my life (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u17JwDa6hTY">video</a>)</strong></h4> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQmDUEv939A">Black Horse and a Cherry Tree</a> is an electrifying song that initially seemed intimidating to me. However, I couldn’t have been more mistaken. It turned out to be one of the most exhilarating moments I’ve ever had, with the audience clapping along and an exciting energy exchange.</p> <script async="" src="https://comments.app/js/widget.js?3" data-comments-app-website="KRdv5SSt" data-limit="5" data-color="B509AC"></script>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not something I usually brag about, but here are some of my performances.]]></summary></entry></feed>
