Writing was my way of understanding myself and others and make sense of what I was going through.</p> <p>Recently though, I’ve been feeling disconnected from writing - it wasn’t giving me the same satisfaction as before, as if my ideas couldn’t reach others in an accessible way. But thanks to generative AI and the <a href="https://challenges.reply.com/ai-film-festival/home/">Reply AI Film Festival</a>, I had the opportunity to breathe new life into one of my old pieces.</p> <p>A thought that had been sitting in my drawer for years finally found its visual form through a short film. It was a unique experience to see my reflections transform from paper to screen, making them more tangible and shareable than ever before.</p> <p><strong>It’s not you</strong> is a short film that delves into the profound sense of loneliness and discomfort fostered by social media. The movie explores how our relentless pursuit of unrealistic standards, often perpetuated by these platforms, leads to a feeling of inadequacy and isolation. At its core, the film highlights our deep-seated need for acceptance—an acceptance that we first must find within ourselves. Through its narrative, It’s Not You encourages viewers to reflect on the impact of social media on their mental well-being and underscores the importance of self-acceptance in an age dominated by digital validation.</p> <p>This video is realized using Midjourney for image generation, Runway for image animation, ElevenLabs for voice generation and Suno.ai for music creation.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATsPmsw2Paw?si=3gHe9mY9pyXbopiW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[And I'm also into short films.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Btw, I sing</title><link href="https://staging.alessiacecere.it/blog/2023/singing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Btw, I sing"/><published>2023-07-26T10:06:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-26T10:06:00+00:00</updated><id>https://staging.alessiacecere.it/blog/2023/singing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://staging.alessiacecere.it/blog/2023/singing/"><![CDATA[<h4 id="2021-12-09-my-first-performance-video"><strong>2021-12-09: My first performance</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJzhAmVY5-A">video</a>)</h4> <p>As I stepped onto the stage at the winter concert of my music school, <a href="https://www.weplaylab.com/">WePlayLab</a>, I was overcome with nerves.</p> <p>It was my first public performance, and I was anxious about everything, from my voice to the vibrato pedal my teacher <a href="https://www.instagram.com/giessevocaltraining/?hl=it">Giulia</a> had convinced me to use. She has a knack for encouraging me to push beyond my limits, and that’s one of the things I like most about her.</p> <p>But as soon as I began singing Agnes Obel’s beautiful song <em>Riverside</em>, all of those fears melted away. I was focused solely on my voice and the message I wanted to convey to the audience. It was like experiencing a new form of honest communication, free from the fear of being misunderstood.</p> <h4 id="2021-12-04-the-first-time-i-played-the-piano-in-public"><strong>2021-12-04: The first time I played the piano in public</strong></h4> <p>This rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mGn6Qf5dEM">Paper Forest</a> was intentionally slowed down, as I was still learning to play the piano.</p> <p>Later on I decided to keep it like that, to encourage more attention to the lyrics. I wanted to transmit that as women we often feel the need to navigate between a safe space and another: this often assumes the shape of a man, whose perspective we risk relying on to explain our thruths.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Now you’re blessed amongst all women,</em> <em>now a man who’s very good.</em> <br/> <em>He tells you how you feel until your life is understood.</em> <br/> <em>And he leads you through it arm in arm as though there was a map to guide the way.</em> <em>Now you write because you love him, now you write because he’s kind.</em> <em>You write so much, you look up and you wrote yourself behind.</em></p> </blockquote> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-IrA-EwNZMg" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" style="padding:10px"></iframe> <h4 id="2023-05-21-piano-arranged-bon-ivers-skinny-love"><strong>2023-05-21: Piano-arranged Bon Iver’s Skinny Love</strong></h4> <p>This piano-version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz5s5C6sAt0">Skinny Love by Bon Iver</a> was arranged by my teacher <a href="https://www.instagram.com/giessevocaltraining/?hl=it">Giulia</a> and I loved it at first sound. Performing it on stage was a huge emotion, expecially because the song meaning resonated with some personal experiences of struggling in letting go I needed to give voice to.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>And I told you to be patient,</em><br/> <em>and I told you to be fine.</em><br/> <em>And I told you to be balanced,</em><br/> <em>and I told you to be kind.</em><br/> <em>And now, all your love is wasted,</em><br/> <em>then who the hell was I?</em><br/> <em>‘Cause now I’m breaking at the bridges, and at the end of all your lies.</em></p> </blockquote> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WugNeS8eP4k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <h4 id="2023-05-21-the-funniest-performance-of-my-life-video"><strong>2023-05-21: The funniest performance of my life (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u17JwDa6hTY">video</a>)</strong></h4> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQmDUEv939A">Black Horse and a Cherry Tree</a> is an electrifying song that initially seemed intimidating to me. However, I couldn’t have been more mistaken. It turned out to be one of the most exhilarating moments I’ve ever had, with the audience clapping along and an exciting energy exchange.</p> <h4 id="2024-12-15-santa-baby-and-christmas"><strong>2024-12-15: Santa Baby and Christmas</strong></h4> <p>This performance at the Christmas recital of my new school, <a href="https://www.sacantomusica.com/">SA Canto e Musica</a>, marked my return to singing after more than a year away from the stage. Thanks to my new teacher Yvette, an actress who inspired me to incorporate little theatrical movements into my performance, I was able to create a unique interpretation. Despite the nerves that came with performing after such a long break, I’m incredibly proud of how the performance turned out - everyone was having fun and I felt light-hearted and filled with Christmas spirit.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kM7Z0baNzE?si=bVV1H7RaWKIVUKuS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <script async="" src="https://comments.app/js/widget.js?3" data-comments-app-website="KRdv5SSt" data-limit="5" data-color="B509AC"></script>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not something I usually brag about, but here are some of my performances.]]></summary></entry></feed>
