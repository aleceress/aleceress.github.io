#### __2021/12/09: My first performance__ ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJzhAmVY5-A))

As I stepped onto the stage at the winter concert of my music school, [WePlayLab](https://www.weplaylab.com/), I was overcome with nerves. 

It was my first public performance, and I was anxious about everything, from my voice to the vibrato pedal my teacher [Giulia](https://www.instagram.com/giessevocaltraining/?hl=it) had convinced me to use. She has a knack for encouraging me to push beyond my limits, and that's one of the things I like most about her.

But as soon as I began singing Agnes Obel's beautiful song _Riverside_, all of those fears melted away. I was focused solely on my voice and the message I wanted to convey to the audience. It was like experiencing a new form of honest communication, free from the fear of being misunderstood. Everyone was paying attention and trying to enter the universe I was creating, utill the last note and applause. 

I was confermed in this when I talked to my boyfriend and one of my best friends, who had come to see me. They told me I was so natural in my performance, and I think that was one of the biggest compliments they could have paid me. Allthough it was time for me to leave for my Erasmus program in Denmark just weeks after the concert (maybe more on this in an other post), I was determined to continue pursuing my musical journey the following year.
