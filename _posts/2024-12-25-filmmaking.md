Since I was a child, I've always written - poems, books, diaries, anything that crossed my mind. Writing was my way of understanding myself and others and make sense of what I was going through. 

Recently though, I've been feeling disconnected from writing - it wasn't giving me the same satisfaction as before, as if my ideas couldn't reach others in an accessible way. But thanks to generative AI and the [Reply AI Film Festival](https://challenges.reply.com/ai-film-festival/home/), I had the opportunity to breathe new life into one of my old pieces. 

A thought that had been sitting in my drawer for years finally found its visual form through a short film. It was a unique experience to see my reflections transform from paper to screen, making them more tangible and shareable than ever before.

<strong>It’s not you</strong> is a short film that delves into the profound sense of loneliness and discomfort fostered by social media. The movie explores how our relentless pursuit of unrealistic standards, often perpetuated by these platforms, leads to a feeling of inadequacy and isolation. At its core, the film highlights our deep-seated need for acceptance—an acceptance that we first must find within ourselves. Through its narrative, It’s Not You encourages viewers to reflect on the impact of social media on their mental well-being and underscores the importance of self-acceptance in an age dominated by digital validation.
