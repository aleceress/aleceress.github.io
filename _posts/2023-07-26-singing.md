#### __2021-12-09: My first performance__ ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJzhAmVY5-A))

As I stepped onto the stage at the winter concert of my music school, [WePlayLab](https://www.weplaylab.com/), I was overcome with nerves. 

It was my first public performance, and I was anxious about everything, from my voice to the vibrato pedal my teacher [Giulia](https://www.instagram.com/giessevocaltraining/?hl=it) had convinced me to use. She has a knack for encouraging me to push beyond my limits, and that's one of the things I like most about her.

But as soon as I began singing Agnes Obel's beautiful song _Riverside_, all of those fears melted away. I was focused solely on my voice and the message I wanted to convey to the audience. It was like experiencing a new form of honest communication, free from the fear of being misunderstood. 


#### __2021-12-04: The first time I played the piano in public__

This rendition of [Paper Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mGn6Qf5dEM) was intentionally slowed down, as I was still learning to play the piano. 

Later on I decided to keep it like that, to encourage more attention to the lyrics. I wanted to transmit that as women we often feel the need to navigate between a safe space and another: this often assumes the shape of a man, whose perspective we risk relying on to explain our thruths.

> _Now you're blessed amongst all women,_
_now a man who's very good._ \
_He tells you how you feel until your life is understood._ \
_And he leads you through it arm in arm as though there was a map to guide the way._ 
_Now you write because you love him, now you write because he's kind._
_You write so much, you look up and you wrote yourself behind._

#### __2023-05-21: Piano-arranged Bon Iver's Skinny Love__

This piano-version of [Skinny Love by Bon Iver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz5s5C6sAt0) was arranged by my teacher [Giulia](https://www.instagram.com/giessevocaltraining/?hl=it) and I loved it at first sound. Performing it on stage was a huge emotion, expecially because the song meaning resonated with some personal experiences of struggling in letting go I needed to give voice to.

> _And I told you to be patient,_\
_and I told you to be fine._\
_And I told you to be balanced,_\
_and I told you to be kind._\
_And now, all your love is wasted,_\
_then who the hell was I?_\
_'Cause now I'm breaking at the bridges, and at the end of all your lies._

#### __2023-05-21: The funniest performance of my life ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u17JwDa6hTY))__

[Black Horse and a Cherry Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQmDUEv939A) is an electrifying song that initially seemed intimidating to me. However, I couldn't have been more mistaken. It turned out to be one of the most exhilarating moments I've ever had, with the audience clapping along and an exciting energy exchange.
