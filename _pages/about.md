...and uhm, you already know my name.


When I was a child I wanted to become a writer, even wrote a poem called _tears_ and won a competition in 2006. This passion encouraged me to do Classical Studies, which I believe shaped my thinking in so many ways.

Now I'm studying Computer Science, with a strong interest in data analysis and visualization. You may feel I chose a very distant field, and for a while I would have agreed with you on that.

But writing is the most genuine way of analyzing ourselves and others: we try to find a path to lean on, opening hundreds of them in the process. At some point, this hunger for answers became more structured, leading me to where I am now.
